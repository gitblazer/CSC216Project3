To Do:

Deck should impelement the Iterable interface

DeckLinkedList should implement DeckLinkedListIterator interface

Create inner class DeckLinkedListIterator in DeckLinkedList

An instance of DeckLinkedListIterator is returned via the DeckLinkedList.iterator() method
Your DeckLinkedListIterator should satisfy the contract defined by java.util.Iterator:

next() should throw a NoSuchElementException if the next element isn't available
remove() should throw an UnsupportedOperationException since it is not needed for this project

Update deck display when deck updates 
add highlighting of updated cards on step by step
add highlighting of keystream card on letter by letter
add highlighting of letter that was output for letter by letter
remove highlighting after running to completion

Use a fresh deck when getting a new message

Use pop-up dialogs for exceptions
	invalid file
